# AIGAME


AIGAME is a trained_model for a lot of classic games.

The purpose of this project is to see if an AI can beat us on the most classic cards/dice game.

Some results were interesting. Overall this AI is a lot less greedy than we are. Even when we reward the model within a single game.

More to come
